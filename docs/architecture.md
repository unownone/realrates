# RealRates by Spenddy - Architecture Document

## Overview

RealRates by Spenddy is a modern, transparent EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator designed to help users understand the true cost of loans in India. The application provides complete transparency by breaking down all hidden costs, taxes, and fees associated with loan conversions, empowering borrowers to make informed financial decisions.

## Problem Statement

In India, when consumers convert purchases to EMI, they often don't realize the true cost due to:

- Hidden processing fees
- GST on interest payments
- GST on processing fees
- Complex interest calculations
- Lack of transparency in fee structures
- Confusing bank fee structures

## Core Value Proposition

RealRates by Spenddy provides a simple, transparent interface that shows users:

1. **True Total Cost**: The actual amount they'll pay over the loan term
2. **Detailed Breakdown**: Every component of the cost (principal, interest, fees, taxes)
3. **Custom Fee Input**: Support for both fixed amounts and percentage-based fees
4. **Educational Value**: Understanding how each component contributes to the total cost
5. **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized experience across all devices
6. **Privacy-Focused**: No personal or financial data collection

### Data Models

#### Calculator Inputs

```typescript
interface CalculatorInputs {
  principal: number;                    // Purchase amount in INR
  interestRate: number;                 // Annual interest rate (e.g., 15%)
  loanTerm: number;                     // Loan duration in months
  selectedBank: string;                 // Selected bank identifier

  noCostEMIDiscount?: number;           // Discount for no-cost EMI
}
```

#### Loan Calculation Result

```typescript
interface LoanCalculation {
  emi: number;                          // Monthly EMI amount

    originalEMI: number;
    discountedEMI: number;
    totalSavings: number;
    effectiveInterestRate: number;
  };
}
```

  };
}
```

### Core Calculation Engine

#### EMI Calculation Algorithm

```typescript
// Standard EMI formula
// EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
export function calculateEMI(principal: number, annualRate: number, termMonths: number): number {
  if (annualRate === 0) {
    return principal / termMonths;
  }
  
  const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
  const emi = principal * monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, termMonths) / 
              (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, termMonths) - 1);
  
  return Math.round(emi);
}
```

#### Fee Structure Components

1. **Processing Fees**
   - Fixed amount (e.g., ₹299, ₹500)
   - Percentage of principal (e.g., 1%, 2%)
   - Custom user input (fixed or percentage)

2. **Tax Calculations**
   - GST on interest: 18% of total interest
   - GST on processing fees: 18% of processing fees
   - Total GST = GST on interest + GST on processing fees
